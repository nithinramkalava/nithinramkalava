## V. DETAILED PROJECT PORTFOLIO
1.  **Project Title: PC Building Assistant Platform (Hybrid AI Recommendation System)**
    *   **Core Goal:** To de-risk and make more efficient the process of building a custom Personal Computer for users of all expertise levels.
    *   **Detailed Description:** This project introduces an intelligent recommendation system featuring a hybrid architecture. For novice users, a conversational Large Language Model (LLM - Ollama with Qwen 2.5 14B model) interprets natural language requests (budget, use case, preferences) which are then structured into JSON for backend processing. For expert users, a traditional step-by-step builder interface (Next.js/React frontend) offers granular control. The system's core is a Python backend (PCRecommendationSystem class) that leverages Machine Learning (Gradient Boosting via Scikit-learn) to rank components based on data-driven value/performance assessments (predicting market price or a synthetic score). Crucially, a PostgreSQL database acts as an active knowledge base, rigorously enforcing hardware compatibility (CPU-motherboard socket, RAM generation/speed, PSU wattage, physical clearances, PCIe/M.2/SATA standards) through embedded PL/pgSQL stored functions. This ensures configuration validity irrespective of the user interface. The system also features dynamic budget allocation, strategically distributing funds across component categories (CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.) based on the user’s intended purpose (e.g., gaming, professional work), reflecting Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) principles. An intelligent fallback strategy ensures a complete build is always proposed, even if it requires relaxing initial constraints or slightly exceeding budget. The project involved creating a full data pipeline: data was initially sourced from publicly available resources (like PCPartPicker), then underwent extensive cleaning, standardization (unifying units, naming), structuring, and ingestion into dedicated PostgreSQL tables. Additional attributes like market segment were programmatically derived using SQL.
    *   **Key Features/Technical Highlights:**
        *   Dual User Interface (Conversational LLM for Novices + Expert Step-by-Step Builder).
        *   Database-Centric Knowledge Base & Compatibility Enforcement (PostgreSQL + PL/pgSQL).
        *   End-to-End Data Pipeline (Web Scraping, Data Cleaning, Standardization, Transformation, Loading into DB).
        *   Machine Learning for Component Ranking (Python, Scikit-learn - Gradient Boosting Regressor, Pandas, NumPy).
        *   Dynamic, Use-Case Driven Budget Allocation (MCDM principles).
        *   LLM Integration (Ollama - Qwen 2.5 14B) for Natural Language Understanding & Slot Filling.
        *   Comprehensive Fallback Logic for build completion.
        *   Modular Multi-Tier System Architecture (Frontend: Next.js/TypeScript; API Layer: Next.js API Routes; Core Logic: Python; Database: PostgreSQL).
    *   **Tech Stack:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Joblib, psycopg2), TypeScript, Next.js (v14+), React, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL (v14+, PL/pgSQL), Ollama, REST APIs.

The library is designed for ease of use by web developers, distributed via NPM, and adheres strictly to FIPS specifications and implementation guidelines (e.g., no floating-point arithmetic, use of Uint8Array for data, secure random byte generation via platform APIs). It features a consistent public API (keygen, encapsulate/sign, decapsulate/verify) across all supported algorithms and parameter sets (ML-KEM-512/768/1024; ML-DSA-44/65/87; SLH-DSA-SHA2-128f/192f/256f). Internal architecture is modular, with shared helper modules for CRYSTALS lattice mathematics (including NTT implementation) and general utilities (hashing, data conversion). Performance benchmarks on an Apple M2 processor demonstrated practical viability (e.g., ML-KEM-768 keygen >2,300 op/s; ML-DSA-65 sign ~386 op/s).
    *   **Detailed Description ('PQC-Vizz' Tool):** Built 'PQC-Vizz', an interactive web application using Next.js/React/TailwindCSS, that directly utilizes the 'pqc' library to provide live, in-browser demonstrations of the PQC algorithms. It allows users to select algorithms/parameters, execute operations, view inputs/outputs (keys, ciphertexts, signatures, shared secrets) in hex, and see performance metrics. Key features include SVG-based visualizations of high-level algorithmic flows (e.g., KeyGen -> Encapsulate -> Decapsulate) with step highlighting, conceptual representations of data structures, and integrated educational text explaining PQC concepts and standards. Deployed on Vercel.
