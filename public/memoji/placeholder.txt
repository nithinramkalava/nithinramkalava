For the chat section to work with the memoji feature, you need to create the following memoji images:

1. Place your memoji images in this directory with these filenames:
   - greeting.png - A waving or greeting expression
   - thinking.png - A thoughtful expression (finger on chin or similar)
   - talking.png - An expression with mouth open as if speaking
   - idle.png - A neutral expression

You can create these using Apple's Memoji feature if you have an iOS device, 
or use any avatar creator that allows for these expressions.

Each image should be a PNG with transparent background, ideally 300x300 pixels or larger.

If you don't have memojis ready, you can use any avatar images with similar expressions,
or replace the Image component in the chat-section.tsx file with a different visual element.
