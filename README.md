## üë®‚Äçüíª A Little About Me

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate (B.Tech from VVIT, Guntur, Class of 2025) with a huge passion for diving deep into the world of software. I love the challenge of building cool, intelligent solutions that solve real problems ‚Äì whether that's crafting user-friendly web applications, exploring the frontiers of AI and Machine Learning, or even implementing advanced cryptographic libraries.

You'll usually find me exploring the intersection of **Full-Stack Development**, **Data Science**, and cutting-edge fields like **Post-Quantum Cryptography**. I get a real kick out of seeing a complex idea come to life as a functional, efficient, and hopefully elegant piece of software. For me, it's all about continuous learning and pushing what's possible.

- üî≠ Currently tinkering with advanced AI models and ways to make complex tech more accessible.
- üå± Always learning! Right now, I'm deepening my understanding of cloud-native architectures and MLOps.
- üëØ I'm always open to collaborating on interesting open-source projects or innovative ideas in Data Science, AI, or Web Development.
- üí¨ Let's chat about anything tech! I particularly enjoy discussions around **React/Next.js, Python, Machine Learning challenges, the future of Cryptography, or even just cool Linux distros!**
- üòÑ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you might find me building a custom PC, lost in a good movie, or meticulously assembling Lego sets.
